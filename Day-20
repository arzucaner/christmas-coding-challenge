Question:

Write a function once that takes another function fn as an argument and returns a new function that ensures fn is called at most once.
The first time the returned function is called, it should call fn and return its result. For any subsequent calls, it should return undefined.

Solution:

function once(fn) {
    let called = false;

    return function (...args) {
        if (!called) {
            called = true;
            return fn(...args);
        }
        return undefined;
    };
}
