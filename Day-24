Question:

Write a function customReduce that replicates the behavior of the built-in Array.prototype.reduce method. The customReduce function should take an array, a callback function, and an initial value as arguments, and return a single value that results from applying the callback function to each element of the array. You cannot use the built-in reduce method.

Constraints:

The input array may contain numbers, strings, or objects.
The callback function will receive four arguments:
The accumulator (the running total/result).
The current element.
The index of the current element.
The entire array.

Solution:
