Question

Throttling is a programming pattern used to limit the number of times a function is called over a specified period. Implement a custom throttle function in JavaScript.

The throttle function should take two arguments:

fn - The function to throttle.
delay - The number of milliseconds to wait before allowing fn to be invoked again.
The throttle function should return a new function that ensures fn is executed at most once in every delay milliseconds, regardless of how many times it is called during that period.
