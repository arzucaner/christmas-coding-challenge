# Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 - JavaScript Solutions

Welcome to my **Christmas Coding Challenge 2024** repository! This project is organized by the **[Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/)**. Through this challenge, I'm committing to solving one [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problem each day using JavaScript. The goal is to build consistent coding habits, improve my problem-solving skills, and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.

## ðŸ“… Challenge Goals

- Solve **one LeetCode problem daily** in JavaScript.
- Focus on a variety of topics such as arrays, strings, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.
- Document each solution with explanations and, if relevant, alternative approaches or optimizations.
