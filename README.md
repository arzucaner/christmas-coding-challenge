# ðŸŽ„Christmas Coding Challenge 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Christmas Coding Challenge 2024** repository! This challenge was organized by the **Women Coding Community**. Over the past 25 days, I committed to solving one coding problem each day using JavaScript. The goal was to strengthen coding habits, enhance problem-solving skills, and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures.
